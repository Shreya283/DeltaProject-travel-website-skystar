TravelEase is a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb, designed to provide users with a seamless experience for booking accommodations and exploring travel destinations.
Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), this application features a secure user authentication system, a dynamic booking system, and the ability for users to browse, search, and filter travel listings. 
Hosts can create and manage listings, and guests can leave reviews and ratings. TravelEase integrates with Cloudinary for image management, Google Maps for interactive location displays, and SendGrid for transactional emails. 
The responsive, mobile-first design ensures a smooth experience across all devices, showcasing the power of modern web technologies in a real-world application.
